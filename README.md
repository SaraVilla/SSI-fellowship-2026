Slides and video recording for application to the [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) 2026 Fellowship programme](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/fellowship-programme) are openly available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17524804)

My application focuses on the cross analysis on contextualised community management strategies in different scientific communities and how to leverage and build best practices informed by the learnings form these communities.
